# ProjectE-Integration
ProjectE Support for selected mods

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Description:</strong></span></p>
<p>This mod will be the bridge between ProjectE and all <del>your</del> my favourite mods!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PEI will be adding ProjectE conversion mapping support to these mods crafting mechanics.</p>
<p>This means you will not have to manually set EMC for these mods recipes, instead, this mod will tell ProjectE about these recipes and what they mean. This means you can use ProjectE built-in commands to setEMC and reloadEMC on the fly without having to worry about having to manually set the EMC for all items affected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PEI will later on also be adding EMC to the mods Items that don't have emc assigned to it.</p>
<p>Sadly this can't be done without restricting the EMC values, this means that setEMC and reloadEMC won't work for these items.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Lore:</strong></span></p>
<p>This mod was inspired by Expanded Equivalence and was started because I tried to work on Expanded Equivalence by decided it would be better to make a separate mod that does everything without Core Modding.</p>
