# ProjectE-Integration (PEI)
This mod will be the bridge between [ProjectE] and all ~~my~~ your favourite mods!    

## NOTE:
> I am currenty stumped by a road block for a while and I have been quite busy. Sadly this has resulted in halted progress.
> I will pick up the mod later.
    
PEI will be adding [ProjectE] conversion mapping support to these mods crafting mechanics.    
This means you will not have to manually set EMC for these mods recipes, instead, this mod will tell [ProjectE] about
these recipes and what they mean. This means you can use [ProjectE] built-in commands to setEMC and reloadEMC on the
fly without having to worry about having to manually set the EMC for all items affected.    
    
PEI will later on also be adding EMC to the mods Items that don't have emc assigned to it.
